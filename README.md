    - For frontend (HTML/CSS/JS): open index.html in a browser.
    - For Node.js: run npm install and then node filename.js.
    - For Django: use python manage.py runserver.
    - For Java: compile and run using javac and java.

**External Tools & APIs Used**

- **OpenWeatherMap** – to get weather data
